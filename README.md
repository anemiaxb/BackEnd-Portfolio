# Python-3.7-Source
 I'm Andrew and I have recently picked up programming. I chose to learn this skill because I am very interested in
 learning how to write code for ML and DS. My goal is to  show enough skill and determination through my source codes
 that I can join the workforce as a Python programmer. Thanks for viewing this and I encourage any pulls to help guide 
 me in the right direction.
